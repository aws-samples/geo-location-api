# geo-location-api
aws-samples .NET Web API for retrieving geolocations. Geolocation data provided by MaxMind GeoLite2.

This project contains the code for the Secure & Observe .NET Containerized Workloads on Amazon ECS on Fargate Workshop. You can find the content and instructions for the workshop here.

If you are building this sample on your own, you can find the fully functional code in [/src/](/src/). 

## Architecture Overview

Here is a high-level overview of the solutions. In the workshop, students will use the AWS CDK and learn how to protect .NET APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources using AWS WAF. Also learn how to set up and configure AWS X-Ray using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry to collect and send metrics and traces to AWS X-Ray to gain visibility into the web traffic for your application.
